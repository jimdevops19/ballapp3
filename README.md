# ballapp3
This is my ballapp3 project

## This is my favorite Python project, among of all. I track here my free throw shooting in basketball when I randomly train

If you visit [here](web/ballapp3/session/data/free_throw), you will see json files that each json represents a shooting session

This project has a private repo that creates an EC2 with Terraform, runs an Ansible playbook to configure the created EC2, that configures and runs a compose service, where the Flask app is hosted

This is awesome, because it gives me the ability to turn on the application before I go playing basketball, and turn off when I come back home, because I only need this EC2 to run when I play :)

The Project of the automation is not added yet to my repo

Here is a demo of the Flask app though, cool isn't it ?
